        Exercise Sheet 5: External Scripts.
        ///////////////////////////////////

        Now that we have learned that HTML tags can have attributes, we can discover a few important attributes of the <script> tag. 
    -->
    <title>External Scripts</title>
  
    <body>
        
        <div id="above">
            Marie Curie
        </div>

        <!-- You can break a tag declaration on multiple lines -->
        <div 
            id="below">
           Brendan Eich
        </div>

        Exercise 1. External Scripts
        //////////////////////////////////

        Most of the times you won't write JavaScript code directly inside the HTML page. There are a number of reasons:

        1. It's messier, you wont to separete logic and representation as much as possible (sometimes you even use different editors).
        2. It makes harder to implement JS workflows, e.g., to compressed or merged together multiple files before being included in a page.
        3. It can make loading slower (because files are not optimized or because they block loading the rest of the page).

        You can link an external js file with the "src" attribute. There is a file inside the js/ folder named external_scripts.js. Load it in here.
        Hint: make sure to place it at the bottom, just before </body> otherwise funny things may happen.

    -->
        <script src="js/external_scripts.js" async></script>
    </body>

    

    <!-- 

        Exercise 2. Defer, Async attributes.
        ////////////////////////////////////

        The previous exercise hinted that you should place the script at the bottom, as we know already. However, there are some alternatives.

        Really, I could try explaining what async and defer do in here, but I think it's just easier to look at the illustrations in this superb StackOverflow answer: 
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10808109/script-tag-async-defer
        
        Perhaps, what I can teach you is how to check whether that is claimed in that answer is true. Open the Network Tab of DevTools to check exactly what is loaded when.

        To make it more interesting, you may download a larger JS file, e.g., the Bootstrap bundle from the Bootstrap CDN: https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/


    -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous" defer></script>
    
    <!-- 

        Exercise 3. Bonus. window.onload
        ////////////////////////////////

        We know that JavaScript is full of alternatives, so why not yet another way of deferring loading a JS script?

        We could use window.onload.

        We haven't learn about yet about callbacks and events, so this is a bonus exercise. Feel free to come back here, after you reached
        Just wrap everything inside a function bound to the 
        onload event to be on the safe side.


            window.onload = function() { ... };

        
        Checkpoint.
        There is an important implication to understand with 
        wrapping your code inside a function: all variables declared in the onload
        function will no longer be available outside of it.
        How can you to display its value in the JS console without
        entering the debug mode?
