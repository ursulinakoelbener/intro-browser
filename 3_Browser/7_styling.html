        Exercise Sheet 7: Styling
        /////////////////////////

        Did you know that there are four ways of styling a page? Why four? Why not? (actually, five if you include the CSS inspector in the browser) 

        This is exactly why they are called CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). 
        
    -->

<title>Styling</title>


<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css" />

<style>
    body {
  /* 
    Specify the font that the browser should use. 
    If a font is not available, it goes to the next one.
  */
  font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
}

/* 
  Applies to the element with id "below" 
  (pound sign indicates the id).
*/
#below {
  color: red;
}

#above {
  color: orangered;
}

/* A dot followed by name create a class that can be applied to any element. */

.large {
    font-size: 40px;
}

/* Styles can contain multiple rules that will be applied together. */

.centered {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
    text-align: center;
}

.wide {
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 10px;
}
  </style>


</head>

<body>

    <!-- The class attribute associates one or more classes to elements -->
    <div id="above" class="large centered">
        Important People 
    </div>

    <div id="above" class="large centered">
        Marie Curie
    </div>

    <!-- Option 3: the inline "style" attribute -->
    <div id="below" class="large centered">
        Brendan Eich
    </div>


    <!-- 

            Exercise 1. The <style> tag.
            ////////////////////////////

            We have seen the external CSS file in the previous Exercise Sheet.
            Here, we learn about the <style> tag.

            The <style> is the equivalent of the linked CSS file, when the CSS file is not linked at all. That is, you write CSS syntax in here. 
            So, the <style> tag is equivalent to the <script> tag for JS.

            a. Add a <style> tag somewhere on the page. You know already that where you place it matters. Add it after the <link> tag that you imported in the previous exercise. 
            
            Copy over the content of the linked CSS inside the <style> tag. This time, set the color of the text inside the element with id "below" to "black".

            b. Checkpoint. Now the external CSS files says that the text inside the div "below" should be red, while the <style> tag says that it should be black. Who wins the argument? And why? This is the magic of the **cascading** style sheets.

        -->
        <div class="large centered" style="text-transform: uppercase">
            Hedwig Dohm
        </div>
    <!-- 

            Exercise 2. Inline styles.
            //////////////////////////

            You can also add a "style" attribute directly to a tag. This attribute is the closest to the tag, and it has priority over both external CSS and <style> tags.

            Make the text inside the element with id "below" all uppercase.

        -->
        <div id="below" class="large centered" style="text-transform: uppercase">
            Hedwig Dohm
        </div>
    <!-- 

            Exercise 3. JavaScript styling.
            ///////////////////////////////

           You noticed that you can add a style attribute to the HTML elements directly. Does that mean that the corresponding JavaScript objects have a style property? 
           
           Yes! By modifying the style property in the object we can add / remove styles to the elements.

           Get the element with id "above" and make it look more like the header of web site. Feel free to give it your own look, or follow the suggestions below.
           
           a. Pick a nice a backround color.

           b. Add a border.

           c. Drop a shadow around it.
           Hint: The property box-shadow contains a minus, how to deal with it?

           d. Make rounded borders.
           
           e. Make the font size larger. For instance: 3rem. What is a rem? Learn more about units of absolute and relative length here:

            Exercise 4. Good artists borrow, great artists steal.
            /////////////////////////////////////////////////////

            This quote was favorite of Steve Jobs but he but he was probably (mis)quoting Pablo Picasso who said "Lesser artists borrow; great artists steal" – who in turn might be rephrasing Igor Stravinsky, but both sayings may well originate in T. S. Eliot’s dictum: "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different than that from which it is torn."
            
            The origins of this quote itself is an example of great artists stealing. 

            I did still this quote from:

            https://www.uvu.edu/arts/applause/posts/stealing.html
           
            And of course that web site stole it from somewhere else.

            The point is that there is plenty of "inspiration" on the web for great styles. For example, check out:

            https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/ by Lea Verou


            Try out some of CSS patterns as a background of the body, or of the other containers.

            Exercise 5. More on classes.
            ////////////////////////////

             You noticed that you can add a class attribute to the HTML elements directly. Does that mean that the corresponding JavaScript objects have a class property? 
             
             No! In fact, in JS the attribute "class" is mapped to the property "className". Why is that? It's simple, "class" is a reserved word in JavaScript (to create JavaScript classes).
             
             a. Create a new class named .disposable inside the <style> tag, and then add it to the <body> element. 

             b. Now remove it from the <body> element.

             c. All easy so far. Now, add a new class to "above" element. Note that the "above" element already has some classes, make sure to not delete those.
            // Hint: just leave a space...

             d. Now delete the it from the "above" element. You can simply remove it from the className property, but it's not as straightforward as before. Things are not as it used to be. Ah the good old times. And so on...Unless you use the .classList property.

            Exercise 6. querySelector returns.
            //////////////////////////////////

            You noticed that the CSS syntax identify the id of an element with the pound sign (#). You remember (vaguely) that the querySelector can also uses pound sign (#) to identify ids.

            Now, if CSS classes uses a dot (.) to identify classes, guess what is the identifier for classes used by querySelector? 
             
            That's right, it's the percent sign (%). 
             
            Just kidding, it's the dot (.), but you could have expected anything from JavaScript at this point, could you?

            a. Go ahed and use the querySelector to select classes.
