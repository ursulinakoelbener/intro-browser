        Exercise Sheet 6: CSS
        /////////////////////

        We have learned of tags, attributes, and external files.
        But the page still looked terrible.
        Now we need to learn how to be stylish.

        There are four ways of styling a page, because why not?
        All involve knowning a little bit of the CSS syntax.

        CSS are extremely powerful, can be very large and complex. 
        Luckily, their syntax is straightforward and intuitive.
        For a beginner entrypoint to CSS see:
        https://www.w3schools.com/Css/
        
    -->

        <title>CSS</title>

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css" />

    </head>
    <body>
        
        <!-- The class attribute associates one or more classes to elements -->
        <div id="above" class="large wide">
           Marie Curie
        </div>

        <!-- Option 3: the inline "style" attribute --> 
        <div id="below" class="large centered">
           Brendan Eich
        </div>

            Exercise 1. External CSS Files.
            ///////////////////////////////

            The folder css/ contains a file named style.css. This files contains instructions for styling the page. 

            a. Link the external file in this page. As usual, where you place matters. Unlike JS files, CSS files tend to be placed on the top of the page, because you want the browser to start rendering the content of the page with the appropriate style, rather then updating it later, when the CSS is loaded.
            Hint: you don't use the <script> tag, but another one.

            b. Make sense of what is going on in here. A CSS rule is componsed by a "selector" and a number styling directives. There are three most basic selectors:

            1. A tag 
            
            Example: div { ... }

            The style will be applied to all elements with tag <div>. This selector is not often used because it is too broad. 

            2. An id
            
            Example: #below { ... }
            
            The style will be applied to the element with ID "below". The use of this selector should also be limited because it leads to less maintainable, slower styling when you habe too many different ids. 

            3. A class:

            Example: .large

            The style will be applied to all elments with class "large". This is how you should define most of your styles. Classes are flexible, reusable, and can be easily combined together.

            Exercise 2. CSS Superhero.
            //////////////////////////

            The CSS contains several classes definitions, but no element in this page has a class. Yet. It's your chance to become a CSS classes superhero and distributing free classes to the elements with id "above" and "below"!

            a. Add the class "large" to both "above" and "below".
            Hint: class=...

            b. Well done, but don't stop now. Now you can add even more classes to those elements. Superheros don't give up so quickly! Add the "wide" class to the element "above" and the "centered" class to the element "below".
            Hint: do not remove the previous classes.

            Exercise 2. The CSS Inspector.
            //////////////////////////////

            You can visualize the current CSS property of an element with DevTools.

            Right click on Brendan Eich on the page rendered by the browser, select "Inspect" (or the equivalent in your language).

            Make sure that the inspector is sufficiently large (or tall) so that the CSS inspector is shown. 

            Play around with the options and get familiar with the interface.
