    Exercise Sheet 3: Debugging
    ////////////////////////////

    In here, we learn how to debug your JS code in the browser.

    
    When writing longer and more complex code (but also shorter and simpler code), you sometime want to stop the execution and inspect the state of your variables.

    This process is commonly called step-by-step execution or "debugging".
    It is also very useful when you are learning to code in the browser.

    <body>
        <span>Thanks querySelector <strong>AGAIN</strong></span>
        <div>
            <span>Thanks querySelector <strong>AGAIN</strong></span>
        </div>
        <script>
            debugger;
            let name = 'Brendan';
            let spans = document.querySelectorAll('span');
            spans.forEach(span => {
                let text = span.innerHTML;
                let index = text.indexOf('querySelector');
                let str = text.substring(0, index) + name + ' ' + 
                          text.substring(index + 'querySelector'.length);
                span.innerHTML = str;
            });
        </script>

       
    </body>

            Exercise 1. Stop! debugger!
            ///////////////////////////

            Add a debugger statement as the first line of the script above.

            a. Refresh the page. Nothing happened? Make sure to have the DevTools open when you refresh.

            b. So you managed to stop the execution. Can you manage the debugger interface too? Get familiar with it, and understand the difference between stepping-in and stepping-forward. If you understand it you can also debug step-by-step the body of the forEach's function.

        <!-- 

            Exercise 2. Bonus. Refactor your code.
            //////////////////////////////////////

            If you executed step-by-step the code inside the script above you understand now what it was doing. You also understand that you can improve it a bit. How?

            a. Make your code more general. Create a function that takes two input parameters: a name to replace (before "querySelector") and the replacement (before "Brendan") and accomplishes the same task.

            b. Add more comments. Comments are as important as the code. Make sure to describe what the code is doing.
            Hint: break down longer lines into smaller chunks.

            And don't forget to get the help of the debugger if you need it.
